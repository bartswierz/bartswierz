Since January (2023), I have been working as a frontend developer at Civilience and quickly gained a leadership role as a Frontend co-team lead based on my work within the first few weeks. I collaborate closely across teams(UI/UX Design, Data Science, and Stakeholders) with great people who are helping communities all over the world. As a co-team lead, my responsibilities include task delegation and ensuring tasks are completed by the deadline and of high quality. I also take care of the weekly Front-end progress demonstrations to stakeholders, UI/UX Design Leads, and Data Science team. We are building some great applications that is intended to be used by communities helping to improve their understanding of their emotional health. I love knowing my contributions as a Frontend Developer are going towards a great cause.
