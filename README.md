# Hi, there :wave:

**I'm Bart, a Full Stack Developer with a focus on front-end technologies who loves Web Development!** 

## 🚀 My Journey - 🌐 [My Portfolio](https://bartoszswierzynski.com/) 🔗

For the past 3+ years, my primary focus has been **front-end** web development, where I’ve built, owned, and scaled production applications using modern UI frameworks and tooling. In my most recent role at [Manifest ↗](https://secure.usemanifest.com), I independently managed four complex applications powering the world’s only 401(k) transfer solution, supporting thousands of monthly transactions. This ownership required deep front-end expertise, proactive learning, and the ability to quickly adopt new technologies to deliver reliable, high-quality features.

During this time, I reduced weekly Sentry errors by ~50%, implemented a custom partner URL solution, and delivered major features across core applications. Previously, at [Civilience ↗](https://www.civilience.social), I co-led a 5-person team, collaborated cross-functionally with UI/UX, Data Science, and leadership, improved team efficiency by over 30%, and shortened product delivery timelines by 2–3 weeks. Having a **growth mindset, being proactive, and being able to complete tasks with little instructions** is what allowed me to be successful in these two roles, I looked at any obstacles and challenges as an opportunity for learning. You will often find me honing my craft mastering the front-end and also learning other technologies on the back-end to add to my set of tools.

While front-end development remains my specialty, I’ve intentionally expanded into back-end technologies to better understand the full web stack, collaborate more effectively across teams, and build more robust, scalable front-end solutions. This full-stack perspective has made me a stronger, more thoughtful web developer.

Feel free to explore some of the projects I’ve built over the years on my portfolio website.
