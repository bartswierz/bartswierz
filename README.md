- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm a senior at DePaul University anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Summer of 2023. During my degree, I was able to get an intermediate understanding of various programming languages exposing to me a large area of programming. I have also taken a few courses regarding mySQL that have been very beneficial for my understanding of relational databases. I feel blessed for my experiences because it let me hone in one the area I want to specialize in. I am passionate about front end web development and have been putting all my free time into getting a deeper understanding on React. My interest in learning web development, alongside my courses at DePaul, led me to using online resources such as MDN Docs, udemy courses, blogs, and whatever else I can get my hands on to become better. To prevent myself from falling into an unendless cycle of tutorials, I made it a point to finish my udemy courses start to finish and then test my knowledge through personal projects. By putting away the videos during my projects, I was able to struggle but learn from my mistakes resulting in a higher understanding of the material. This approach made it very beneficial to me as I learn best from working on personal projects over tutorials and lectures.
