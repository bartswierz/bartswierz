- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm currently a DePaul University student and anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Fall of 2022. During my degree, I was able to get an understanding of various programming languages such as: Python, Java, C, C++, Scala, Scheme, Lisp, and mySQL. Recently, I have grown an interest in Web Development. I have taken a web development course that went over full stack design and was exposed to React and Node.ks, along with a few other tools. I am really enjoying learning the fundementals of HTML and CSS. I always loved to build things from scratch so seeing a webpage come to life is amazing. Through online resources including instructional videos to Udemy courses, I was able to become strong in HTML and CSS through a Udemy course. They allowed me to go from knowing minimal HTML to being able to create a real-world responsive web designed project. After completing the course, I am strengthening what I learned by brainstorming ideas for three to six landing pages for my portfolio.

- 💞️ I'm currently learning: 
  - The fundementals of HTML and CSS by coding alongside a online course and testing my knowledge by creating a mock HTML page without looking back at the course content. This      strategy has been great at retaining information.
