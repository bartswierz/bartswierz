- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart Swierzynski, I'm currently a DePaul University student and anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Fall of 2022. During my degree, I was able to get an understanding of various programming languages such as: Python, Java, C, C++, Scala, Scheme, Lisp, and mySQL. While I took my first steps into the programming world with Python, I am most comfortable in Java. Recently, I have grown an interest in Web Development. I am really enjoying learning the fundementals of HTML and CSS. I always loved to build things from scratch so seeing a webpage come to life is amazing.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning: 
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
   - React

- 🌱 Hobbies: 
   - Car Enthusiast 
   - Hiking
   - Occassional gaming

- 🌱 I’m currently working on:
   - I have java project in mind that brings out my love of cars with the design structure of the program nearly complete. 
   - Ideas for my first personal website regarding content and layout. I will be utilizing HTML and CSS.
   - Ideas for creating a photography webpage for a family friend.
   - Ideas for creating a interior design webpage for a family friend
 
- 💞️ I'm currently learning: 
  - The fundementals of HTML and CSS by coding alongside a online course and testing my knowledge by creating a mock HTML page without looking back at the course content. This      strategy has been great at retaining information.
