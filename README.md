- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm a recent graduade with an Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from DePaul University(Chicago, IL). Since January, I have been interning and have quickly gained leadership roles as a Frontend Co-Team Lead based on my work. I collaborate closely across teams(UI/UX Design, Data Science) with great people who are helping communities all over the world. As a co-team lead, my responsibilities include task delegation and ensuring tasks are completed by the deadline and are of high quality. I also take care of the weekly Front-end progress demonstrations to the founder, supervisors, and the Data Science team. We are building some great applications that is intended to be used by communities helping to improve their understanding of their emotional health. I love knowing my contributions as a Frontend Developer are going towards a great cause that will help people. I am passionate about front end web development and have been putting all my free time into getting a deeper understanding of the frontend elevating my skills. My github repository is only growing, and with decently sized projects at that. My latest project is building a scalable E-commerce site(Alpha Footwear) utilizing React, Material UI, SCSS, and Firebase. I am also learning TypeScript to further my knowledge working on the Frontend.
