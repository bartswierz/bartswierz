- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm a senior at DePaul University anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Spring of 2023. During my degree, I was able to get a good understanding of various programming languages exposing to me a large area of programming. Getting hands on experience with different languages allowed me to find my choice of specialization and that is Web Development. I am passionate about front end web development and have been putting all my free time into getting a deeper understanding on React. To prevent falling into tutorial hell, I'm learning by building personal projects based around things I enjoy and that has fueled my motivation to keep going month after month. My github repository is only growing, and with decently sized projects at that. My latest project is building a scalable E-commerce site(Alpha Clothing) utilizing React. 

- 👀 I’m interested in learning: 
   - NodeJS
   - Express
   - Firebase

- 🌱 Hobbies: 
   - Car Enthusiast 
   - Hiking
   - Kayaking
   - Occassional gaming

- 🌱 I’m currently working on:
   - An E-Commerce clothing site(https://alpha-clothing.netlify.app/) with React. 
 
- 💞️ I'm currently learning: 
  - Learning more React by building my E-commerce site. Currently have built the products, dynamic cart utilizing Contexts, and a work-in-progress checkout process that I am adding more too. My next task on the list is learning how to integrate account authentication using google authenticate along with Firebase for account and product storage.
