- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm a developer, a current DePaul University student and anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Summer of 2023. During my degree, I was able to get an intermediate understanding of various programming languages such as: Python, Java, C, JavaScript, and more. I have also taken a few courses regarding mySQL that have been very beneficial for my understanding of relational databases. I am passionate about front end web development and have been putting all my free time into getting a deeper understanding of JavaScript before I dive deep into React. I have created a few large and small projects that have really helped drill in the topics I have learned. My interest in learning web development, alongside my courses at DePaul, led me to using online resources such as MDN Docs, udemy courses, blogs, and whatever else I can get my hands on to become better. To prevent myself from falling into an unendless cycle of tutorials, I made it a point to finish my udemy courses start to finish and then test what I have learned through personal projects without relying on course videos. By putting away the videos during my projects, I was able to struggle but learn from my mistakes resulting in a much stronger understanding of the material. This approach made it very beneficial for my learning as I became accustomed to using MDN documentation, stackoverflow, and other useful online resources.
