- 👋 Hi, I’m Bart, I'm a developer and currently a DePaul University student and anticipating completion of my B.S. in Computer Science in the Spring of 2023. During my degree, I was able to get an intermediate understanding of various programming languages such as: Python, Java, JavaScript and mySQL. I am passionate about front end web development and have been putting all my free time into getting a deeper understanding of JavaScript before I dive deep into React. I have created a few large and small projects that have really helped drill in the topics I have learned. Because of my strong interest into learning web development, alongside my courses at DePaul, I have been using online resources such as MDN Docs, udemy courses, blogs, and whatever else I can get my hands on. To prevent myself from falling into an unendless cycle of tutorials, I made it a point to finish my udemy courses start to finish and then test what I have learned through personal projects without referencing back to the videos. By putting away the videos during my projects, I was able to struggle but learn from my mistakesm resulting in a stronger understanding of the material. This approach made it very beneficial for my learning as I became accustomed to using MDN documentation, stackoverflow, and other useful online resources.

I have taken a web development course that went over full stack design and was exposed to React and Node.ks, along with a few other tools. I am really enjoying learning the fundementals of HTML and CSS. I always loved to build things from scratch so seeing a webpage come to life is amazing. Through online resources including instructional videos to Udemy courses, I was able to become strong in HTML and CSS through a Udemy course. They allowed me to go from knowing minimal HTML to being able to create a real-world responsive web designed project. After completing the course, I am strengthening what I learned by brainstorming ideas for three to six landing pages for my portfolio.
